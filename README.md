# TMG-youtube-scrape
Script that scrapes the titles and links to all of TMG's videos. The first step in a project to build the "TMG Bible". The goal is to use an NLP engine to convert the audio files into text. Then build a simple website that will allow users to search for keywords, returning the episode that the text was found in and a link to the episode where it was found.
